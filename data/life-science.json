The entire process can be completed within 20 minutes using a simple protocol. It is suitable for downstream applications such as RT-PCR. Debris and PCR inhibitors are removed through a pre-treatment step, and genomic DNA contamination is minimized using a genomic DNA inhibitor, resulting in high-quality RNA with excellent reproducibility. This product adop a 2-column system incorporating a pre-treatment column.",
